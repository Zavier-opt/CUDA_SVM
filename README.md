# CUDA_SVM

step 1: Implement SVM based on LIBSVM, in python;

step 2: Implement SVM based on LIBSVM, in C;

step 3: Impelement sequential SVM, Linear kernel; (Using the same data input and output processing)

step 4: Implement CUDA based SVM, Linear kernel; (Using the same processing other than the optimzation part in step 3)
